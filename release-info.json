([#3051](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/issues/3051))\r\n- The effect of `pypi.ignore_stored_index` changes a bit. Now even if it is true, index configurations in the config will still be loaded if the index is listed in the `pyproject.toml`. ([#3052](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/issues/3052))\r\n\r\n### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n- Ignore invalid requires-python values from index. ([#3038](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/issues/3038))\r\n- Fix the group selection logic, to make `--without GROUP` work as expected. ([#3045](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/issues/3045))\r\n- Suppress outputs for `pdm python install --quiet`. ([#3049](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/issues/3049))\r\n\r\n\r\n",
