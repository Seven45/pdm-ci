[#2665](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/issues/2665)\n- Fix a race condition in cached packages. When a cached package is being created it shouldn't be used for installation. [#2739](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/issues/2739)\n- Add back `PreparedCandidate.build()` for backward-compatibility. [#2747](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/issues/2747)\n\n### Documentation\n\n- Fixed a small non-code typo in docs and prodivded better wording.
