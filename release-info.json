([#3076](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/issues/3076))\n- Allow pypi.verify_ssl to be configured via PDM_PYPI_VERIFY_SSL environmental variable. ([#3081](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/issues/3081))\n- Clean logs older than 7 days. ([#3091](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/issues/3091))\n- Polish the UI looking of locking packages to display the progress. ([#3100](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/issues/3100))\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n- Fixed `pdm venv activate` to remove quotes such that `iex (pdm venv activate)` works correctly ([#2895](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/issues/2895))\n- Don't crash if the version can't be resolved from the self project. ([#3077](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/issues/3077))\n- Don't fail `install-pdm.py` if there is an invalid `pyproject.toml` file under the current directory. ([#3085](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/issues/3085))\n- Make it able to expand env vars in the the dotenv file. Expose `PDM_PROJECT_ROOT` to the dotenv file for expansion. ([#3087](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/issues/3087))\n- Fix a bug that Python markers from the existing locked packages are considered when locking with `--append` option. ([#3089](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/issues/3089))\n- Backfill urls from configured indexed when exporting to requirements.txt. ([#3094](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/issues/3094))\n- Consider the auto-selected Python range when installing from requirements.txt. ([#3095](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/issues/3095))\n- Fix a bug that env vars do not override project config correctly. ([#3099](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/issues/3099))\n\n\n",
