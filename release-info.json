([#3215](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/issues/3215))\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n- Fix a bug that overrides provided by environment variables do not work. ([#3182](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/issues/3182))\n- Allow prereleases when the requirement is pinned even if disabled by project ([#3202](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/issues/3202))\n- Pass the python path to the uv venv command. ([#3204](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/issues/3204))\n- Fix the infinite loop when running in uv mode if the current project has dynamic metadata. ([#3207](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/issues/3207))\n- Add `--no-frozen-deps` option to `install-pdm.py` script to allow installing newer versions of dependencies. ([#3213](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/issues/3213))\n- `pdm self update` now prefers the locked dependencies unless `--no-frozen-deps` is specified. ([#3216](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/issues/3216))\n- By default, `pdm outdated` will only list direct dependencies. This can be changed by adding the `--include-sub` option. ([#3218](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/issues/3218))\n\n### Documentation\n\n- Show users the way to uninstall pdm in a more obvious way ([#2470](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/issues/2470))\n\n\n",
