([#3113](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/issues/3113))\n- Fix a bug of export command that packages with extras are included twice. ([#3123](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/issues/3123))\n- Remove empty groups when removing packages with `pdm remove`. ([#3133](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/issues/3133))\n- When running `pdm venv purge`, if the current project's python version had been referencing the removed venv then clear it out. ([#3137](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/issues/3137))\n- Fix command `pdm config` to not show site configuration file path if it doesn't exist. ([#3149](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/issues/3149))\n- Now when `--no-markers` is used, the exported requirements can only work on the current platform. ([#3152](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/issues/3152))\n\n### Miscellany\n\n- Skip tests related to python installation on non-standard platforms. ([#3053](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/issues/3053))\n\n\n"
