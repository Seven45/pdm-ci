[#2398](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/issues/2398)\n- Add an option `keep_going` to continue on errors for composite scripts and return the last failing exit code. [#2582](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/issues/2582)\n- Add an option `working_dir` for PDM's scripts to set the current working directory. [#2620](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/issues/2620)\n- Allow updating specific sub-dependencies (i.e., transitive dependencies) in the lock file. [#2628](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/issues/2628)\n- Add `--config-setting` option to `add/install/sync/update/remove/export` commands, the config settings dictionary will be shared by all packages. [#2636](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/issues/2636)\n- Cache the decompressed contents of wheels for faster access. [#2660](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/issues/2660)\n- Add configuration for timeout for network requests. [#2680](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/issues/2680)\n- Reuse the request sesison within the environment. [#2697](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/issues/2697)\n- Caches can be disabled by using the `--no-cache` option or setting the `PDM_NO_CACHE` environment variable. [#2702](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/issues/2702)\n- Switch to `httpx.Client` for HTTP requests, drop `requests` dependency. [#2709](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/issues/2709)\n- We have timemachine now! You can exclude packages published newer than a certain date via `pdm lock --exclude-newer=<date>`, allowing reproduction of resolutions regardless of new package releases. [#2712](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/issues/2712)\n- Add command `pdm outdated` to check the outdated packages and list the latest versions. [#2718](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/issues/2718)\n- When `python.use_venv` is on, always try to create a virtualenv when using `pdm use` to switch the Python interpreter. [#2720](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/issues/2720)\n- Support installing Pythons from [python-build-standalone](https://github.com/indygreg/python-build-standalone). Add command group `pdm python` to manage Python installations. And `pdm use` can automatically install the Python interpreter if it's not found. [#2721](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/issues/2721)\n- Supports custom distribution files path via `-d/--dest` option for `pdm publish`. [#2723](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/issues/2723)\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n- Don't modify TOML tables that are not related to PDM. [#2666](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/issues/2666)\n- Made `--without` imply `--with :all`. [#2670](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/issues/2670)\n- Expand user path for `venv.location` and other path-like config values. [#2672](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/issues/2672)\n- Give a default version when it's missing in `pyproject.toml` when parsing candidate's metadata. [#2677](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/issues/2677)\n- Fix the issue that ANSI codes are shown in the output of `pdm --help` on Windows. [#2678](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/issues/2678)\n- Don't show empty configuration sections in `pdm config`. [#2683](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/issues/2683)\n\n### Documentation\n\n- Document the difference between `[tool.pdm.scripts]` and `[project.scripts]` [#2121](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/issues/2121)\n\n### Removals and Deprecations\n\n- Remove the support of `pth` cache method. And `symlink` cache method now behaves the same as `symlink_individual` cache method. [#2660](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/issues/2660)\n- Remove `pdm.models.environment` module deprecated before. Also remove the renamed members from `pdm.environments`. [#2710](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/issues/2710)\n\n### Miscellany\n\n- Delete `setup.cfg`, move tool configurations under it to `pyproject.toml` [#2703](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/issues/2703)\n\n\n",
