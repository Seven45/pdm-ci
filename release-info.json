[#1908](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/issues/1908)\n- Add support for reading metadata from simple index directly. [#1919](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/issues/1919)\n- Add a configuration to specify constant command arguments for every pdm invocation. [#1923](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/issues/1923)\n- Add ability to skip SSL verification for publish repositories via `repository.custom.verify_ssl` config option as well as new command line argument of `publish` command. [#1928](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/issues/1928)\n- Use lazy import to reduce the startup time of the CLI. [#1929](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/issues/1929)\n- Add the local plugin scripts to `PATH` env var. [#1944](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/issues/1944)\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n- Don't use install cache when installing build requirements to avoid race condition. [#1869](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/issues/1869)\n- Fix a number of `ResourceWarning`s when running the test suite with warnings enabled. [#1915](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/issues/1915)\n- Fix a bug that dev-dependencies group gets updated with the optional dependencies, causing the hash mismatch. [#1916](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/issues/1916)\n- Fix format conversion error from Poetry when `tool.poetry.build` doesn't exist. [#1935](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/issues/1935)\n- Add timeout when fetching .gitignore from GitHub. [#1937](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/issues/1937)\n- Keep the variables in the URL credentials when exporting. [#1939](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/issues/1939)\n- Convert to boolean when setting verify_ssl for custom indexes. [#1945](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/issues/1945)\n- `pdm import` clobbers `build-system.requires` value in `pyproject.toml`. [#1948](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/issues/1948)\n\n### Documentation\n\n- Update publish.md to use run instead of runs to match GitHub Actions steps documentation [#1936](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/issues/1936)\n- Update advanced.md to use `pdm sync` instead of `pdm install --no-lock`. [#1947](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/issues/1947)\n\n\n",
