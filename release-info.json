([#2843](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/issues/2843))\n- Fix the issue of self-referencing extra dependencies failing to be resolved for local packages. ([#2898](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/issues/2898))\n- Fix an issue of max recursion depth error when parsing a poetry project with circular dependencies on local packages. ([#2900](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/issues/2900))\n- Fix a bug that VCS dependencies and `--self` don't work in the exported requirements.txt with hashes. ([#2908](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/issues/2908))\n- Fix a cache miss when there exist built wheels for a given link. ([#2912](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/issues/2912))\n- Don't try to store caches when `--no-cache` is given. ([#2913](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/issues/2913))\n\n\n",
