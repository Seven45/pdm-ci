([#2519](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/issues/2519))\n- Support PEP 723: running scripts with inline metadata in standalone environment with dependencies. ([#2924](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/issues/2924))\n- `pdm use` and `pdm python install` now take `requires-python` into account (incl. from pyproject.toml) if python version\n  not specified and `pdm use` provides auto installation by that. ([#2943](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/issues/2943))\n- `--no-isolation` no longer installs `build-requires` nor dynamic build dependencies, to be consistent with `pip`. ([#2944](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/issues/2944))\n- Add notifiers in CLI output when global project is being used. ([#2952](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/issues/2952))\n- Use `tool.pdm.resolution` table when calculating the content hash of project file, previously only `overrides` table was used.\n  This will change the hash already stored in the lockfile, so bump the lockfile version to `4.4.2`. ([#2956](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/issues/2956))\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n- Add max retries on read timeout or bad connection. ([#2914](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/issues/2914))\n- Don't update local files if they don't change. ([#2966](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/issues/2966))\n- Don't list python versions that don't have any installation link for the current platform. ([#2970](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/issues/2970))\n\n### Documentation\n\n- Clarify the purposes of `pdm outdated` and `--unconstrained` option. ([#2965](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/issues/2965))\n- Some clarifications on the interpreter selection and central package cache. ([#2967](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/issues/2967))\n\n\n",
