  "body": "\n\n### Features & Improvements\n\n- Write installer metadata like `INSTALLER` and `REQUESTED` to dist-info directory when installing packages. ([#3359](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/issues/3359))\n- Respect `.python-version` file in the project root directory when selecting the Python interpreter. By default, it will be written when running `pdm use` command. ([#3367](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/issues/3367))\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n- Fix a problem of missing dependencies when adding to dev dependencies if both editable and non-editable dependencies exist. ([#3361](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/issues/3361))\n- Use stdlib for URL <-> Path conversions. ([#3362](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/issues/3362))\n- `shellingham.detect_shell()` returns `('tcsh', '/bin/tcsh')` for tcsh on FreeBSD, so the current code tries to use the Bash venv activation script and fails due to syntax error. This change fixes the issue. ([#3366](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/issues/3366))\n- Fix a performance issue because pypi source credentials were being queried many times from keyring. ([#3368](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/issues/3368))\n\n\n",
